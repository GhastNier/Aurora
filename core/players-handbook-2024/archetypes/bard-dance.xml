			<em>Move in Harmony with the Cosmos</em>
			<p>Bards of the College of Dance know that the Words of Creation can't be contained within speech or song; the words are uttered by the movements of celestial bodies and flow through the motions of the smallest creatures. These Bards practice a way of being in harmony with the whirling cosmos that emphasizes agility, speed, and grace.</p>

			<p>While you aren't wearing armor or wielding a Shield, you gain the following benefits:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><em><strong>Dance Virtuoso.</strong></em> You have Advantage on any Charisma (Performance) check you make that involves you dancing.</li>
				<li><em><strong>Unarmored Defense.</strong></em> Your base Armor Class equals 10 plus your Dexterity and Charisma modifiers.</li>
				<li><em><strong>Agile Strikes.</strong></em> When you expend a use of your Bardic Inspiration as part of an action, a Bonus Action, or a Reaction, you can make one Unarmed Strike as part of that action, Bonus Action, or Reaction.</li>
				<li><em><strong>Bardic Damage.</strong></em> You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack rolls of your Unarmed Strikes. When you deal damage with an Unarmed Strike, you can deal Bludgeoning damage equal to a roll of your Bardic Inspiration die plus your Dexterity modifier, instead of the strike's normal damage. This roll doesn't expend the die.</li>
